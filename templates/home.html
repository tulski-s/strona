			<p>It is always nice to have proxies.... unfortunately, it is not the same while you have to pay for them. Especially when you just want quite reliable proxies from time to time, just for your personal scraping usage. You may not want to care about VPNs or whatever. What you can do?</p>
			<p>First and easiest thing which come to my mind is just to find free proxies list. There is a lot of them around Internet. What is a problem with that solution? Free proxies are crap... You can easily find lists with hundreds of them, but barely find there 10 nicely working proxies. Even if web-service assure you that they checked those proxies 30s ago, you can't be sure if this proxy is really healthy.</p>
			<p>So... if free proxy list are not perfect solution, should we start to look for another one? Isn't it annoying when you can see hundreds of potential proxies and still can't use them efficiently?br>In this post, instead of searching other proxies source, I will try to get as much as I can from free proxies list. Let's get started!</p>
