            <p>I am a hardworking, passionate and imaginative Python programmer. I have an ability to work hard and smart, handle responsibilities and accomplish my assignments on time. Currently I work at WorldRemit as Big Data Engineer where I can use my Python skills to contribute to our big data platform. I also have great opportunity to learn most up-to-date big-data technology stack.</p>
            <p>My past commercial coding experience comes from my position as a Python Data Programmer at London start-up Import.io. My main responsibilities were building Python and JavaScript web-scrapers and extending functionality of company’s data extraction framework. I also built two UIs: one was python’s flask based web-application for managing team internal work. Second one was visual tool for building advanced configuration files for extraction framework mentioned earlier.</p>
            <p>My other experience comes  from my previous positions as a GIS Programmer and Python Teacher. I also use a lot of Python while working scientifically, mainly with satellite data from NASA.</p>
            <p>There is never a good time to stop learn, so I spend my free time reading technical books and following tutorials. When there is a chance, I like to attend workshops and meetups.</p>

            <h4>Python Data Programmer, SEP 2015 - FEB 2016</h4>
            <p>At the beginning of my work my main tasks were building python and java-script web-scrapers and screening/formatting gathered data.
            To accomplish my goals I have used my problem-solving skills and creativity. Often I had to look for different work around to get data I wanted. Along
            with python and js I used vastly: Regular Expressions and Xpaths.
            <p>Soon I have got a new responsibilities, ie. contributing to python data extraction framework. I have written functions (and 
            unit-tests for them) to make data extraction and cleaning simpler and more automated. </p>
            <p>During my work I also built 2 UIs. First one was web-application (written in python’s flask) for managing team internal work. The 
            second one was visual tool for creating advanced configuration files for earlier-mentioned extraction framework. For later, I used node-red, which is 
            node-js flow-based programming tool. The idea of the 2nd UI appeared after I won (together with my coworker) one of company’s hackathon. We presented 
            there prototype of tool written in python and it’s tkinter library. After that success, the project landed on the official product road-map.</p>

            validation tests showed that my algorithm's detection rate was about 98%.</p>

            <h4>Poster presented at: ESA EO Summer School 2014, 4-14/08, Frascati, Italy</h4>
            <p>Digital elevation model (DEM), i.e. digital representation of the surface of the Earth, is important data source for most of the Earth sciences. Near-global DEMs like the <a href="http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/srtm/" target="_blank">SRTM</a> C-Band enable to understand the Earth as a complex system. Despite of its numerous applications, the SRTM C-Band tends to overestimate elevations over areas where vegetation is present. A novel approach utilizing ICESat ground control points was developed to remove this positive elevation bias.</p>
